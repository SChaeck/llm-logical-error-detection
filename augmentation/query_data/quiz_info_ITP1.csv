In programming languages like C/C++, a goto statement provides an unconditional jump from the ""goto"" to a labeled statement. For example, a statement ""goto CHECK_NUM;"" is executed, control of the program jumps to CHECK_NUM. Using these constructs, you can implement, for example, loops.

Note that use of goto statement is highly discouraged, because it is difficult to trace the control flow of a program which includes goto.

Write a program which does precisely the same thing as the following program (this example is wrtten in C++). Let's try to write the program without goto statements.

void call(int n){
  int i = 1;
 CHECK_NUM:
  int x = i;
  if ( x % 3 == 0 ){
    cout << "" "" << i;
    goto END_CHECK_NUM;
  }
 INCLUDE3:
  if ( x % 10 == 3 ){
    cout << "" "" << i;
    goto END_CHECK_NUM;
  }
  x /= 10;
  if ( x ) goto INCLUDE3;
 END_CHECK_NUM:
  if ( ++i <= n ) goto CHECK_NUM;

  Your task is to calculate the distance between two $n$ dimensional vectors $x = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ and $y = \{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\}$.

  The Minkowski's distance defined below is a metric which is a generalization of both the Manhattan distance and the Euclidean distance.

\[
D_{xy} = (\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}
\]


It can be the Manhattan distance 


\[
D_{xy} = |x_1 - y_1| + |x_2 - y_2| + ... + |x_n - y_n|
\]


where $p = 1 $.



It can be the Euclidean distance

\[
D_{xy} = \sqrt{(|x_1 - y_1|)^{2} + (|x_2 - y_2|)^{2} + ... + (|x_n - y_n|)^{2}}
\]

where $p = 2 $.



Also, it can be the Chebyshev distance


\[
D_{xy} = max_{i=1}^n (|x_i - y_i|)
\]


where $p = \infty$

Write a program which reads two $n$ dimensional vectors $x$ and $y$, and calculates Minkowski's distance where $p = 1, 2, 3, \infty$ respectively.
