<Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors>
    <Description>
        Input error: Input errors occur when the program fails to handle standard input properly. 
        <Detailed situations>
            <Error case 1> When it does not receive the value described in [Input] as standard input. (e.g., trying to use hard-coded values) </Error case 1>
            <Error case 2> When it only receives a part of the values described in [Input] as standard input. (e.g., trying to receive only one line when multiple lines of input are given) </Error case 2>
            <Error case 3> When it receives more than the number of values described in [Input] as standard input. (e.g., trying to receive multiple lines when one line of input is given) </Error case 3>
            <Error case 4> When the input part that is written does not match the description in [Input], other than 1-3. </Error case 4>
            <Error case 5> When the type designation of the Input Variable, which receives and stores standard input, is incorrect. </Error case 5>
            <Error case 6> When there are other unidentified or unspecified errors related to handling standard inputs, beyond the scenarios outlined in Error cases 1-5. </Error case 6>
        </Detailed situations>

    <Example 1>
        [Programming Quiz]: 
        Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints their sum.

        [Input]: 
        The first line contains an integer A, The second line contains an integer B.

        [Output]: 
        Print the sum of A and B.

        [Sample Input]:
        4 5

        [Sample Output]:
        9

        [Submission code]: 
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        int main() {
            int num1, num2;

            num1 = 2; // hard-coded value
            num2 = 3;  // hard-coded value

            int sum = num1 + num2;
            
            cout << sum << endl;
            
            return 0;
        }

        Q: Considering the [Programming Quiz], [Input], [Output], [Sample Input], [Sample Output], and [Submission code], could the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/> occur in the [Submission code]?       
        First, document the reason for your consideration, then conclude the sentence with 'Yes' or 'No'. Should the logical error be correct but fail to align with the description in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>, the response should be 'No'.
        A: This code does not take integer A and integer B as input as described in [Input], but hardcodes the values to num1 and num2 instead. Therefore, even if the user inputs the [Sample Input] into the standard input stream, the program does not receive these values. Thus, this is an Input error, and it is the error that occurred as described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>. "Yes"
    </Example 1>
    <Example 2>
        [Programming Quiz]: 
        Write a program that receives two integers as input and prints the result of subtracting the second integer from the first.

        [Input]: 
        The first line contains an integer A, The second line contains an integer B.

        [Output]: 
        Print the difference of A subtracted by B.

        [Sample Input]:
        6 4

        [Sample Output]:
        2

        [Submission code]: 
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        int main() {
            int num1, num2;

            cin >> num2 >> num1; 

            int dif = num1 - num2; 
            
            cout << dif << endl;
            
            return 0;
        }

        Q: Considering the [Programming Quiz], [Input], [Output], [Sample Input], [Sample Output], and [Submission code], could the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/> occur in the [Submission code]?       
        First, document the reason for your consideration, then conclude the sentence with 'Yes' or 'No'. Should the logical error be correct but fail to align with the description in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>, the response should be 'No'.
        A: This code receives input in a different order from what is specified in [Input]. Therefore, it prints the result of B - A, not A - B. Consequently, when [Sample Input] is entered into the program, the value of [Sample Output] is not printed. Thus, this is an Input error, and it is the error that occurred as described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>. "Yes"
    </Example 2>
    <Example 3>
        [Programming Quiz]: 
        Write a program which prints small/large/equal relation of given two integers a and b.

        [Input]: 
        Two integers a and b separated by a single space are given in a line.

        [Output]: 
        For given two integers a and b, print a < b if a is less than b, a > b if a is greater than b, and a == b if a equals to b.

        [Sample Input]:
        3 2

        [Sample Output]:
        a > b

        [Submission code]: 
        #include<iostream>
        #include<string>
        using namespace std;
        int main()
        {
            int x,y;
            cin >> x >> y;

            if(x > y)   cout << "x > y" << endl; 
            else if(x < y)   cout << "x < y" << endl; 
            else    cout << "x == y" << endl; 

            return 0;
        }

        Q: Considering the [Programming Quiz], [Input], [Output], [Sample Input], [Sample Output], and [Submission code], could the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/> occur in the [Submission code]?       
        First, document the reason for your consideration, then conclude the sentence with 'Yes' or 'No'. Should the logical error be correct but fail to align with the description in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>, the response should be 'No'.
        A: This code does receive the input as required in [Input], and the algorithm is written according to the intention of the [Programming Quiz]. However, while [Output] specifies to print the relationship between the two integers using a and b, the code uses x and y to print the relationship. Therefore, this is an Output error, and it is different from the Input error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>. "No"

        [Programming Quiz]: 
        Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints their sum.

        [Input]: 
        The first line contains an integer A, The second line contains an integer B.

        [Output]: 
        Print the sum of A and B.

        int main() {
            int num1, num2;

            int sum = num1 + num2; // Use num1, num2 without getting the values inputted
            
            cout << sum << endl;
            
            return 0;

        A: This code does not take integer A and integer B as input as outlined in [Input], but uses num1 and num2 without initializing them. Therefore, even if the user inputs the [Sample Input] into the standard input stream, the program does not receive these values. Consequently, this is an Input error, and it is the error that occurred as described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>. "Yes"
