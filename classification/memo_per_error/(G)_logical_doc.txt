    <Description>
        Loop error: Loop errors occur when the declaration part of a loop statement('for', 'while', etc.) is not properly written.
        <Detailed situations>
            <Error case 1> When initialization or assignment is incorrect in the declaration part of a loop statement. </Error case 1>
            <Error case 2> When the condition is wrongly written in the declaration part of a loop statement. </Error case 2>
            <Error case 3> When the increment or decrement expression is incorrect in the declaration part of a loop statement. </Error case 3>
            <Error case 4> When an infinite loop occurs due to cases 1-3 (However, an infinite loop due to the absence of a necessary break is a Branching error). </Error case 4>
            <Error case 5> When an Off by 1 problem occurs due to cases 1-3. </Error case 5>
            <Error case 6> When there are other unidentified or unspecified errors in the declaration or operation of a loop statement, beyond the scenarios described in Error cases 1-5. </Error case 6>
        </Detailed situations>

    <Example 1>
        [Programming Quiz]:
        Write a program that takes an array of integers and calculates the sum of all elements.

        [Input]:
        The first line contains an integer N, representing the size of the array. The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array. 

        [Output]: 
        Print the sum of all elements in the array. 

        [Sample Input]:
        6
        3 1 6 8 7 2

        [Sample Output]:
        27

        [Submission code]: 
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        int main() {
            int N;
            
            cin >> N;
            
            int arr[N];
            int sum = 0;

            for(int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
                cin >> arr[i]; 
                sum += arr[i];
            }
            
            cout << sum << endl;
            
            return 0;
        }

        Q: Considering the [Programming Quiz], [Input], [Output], [Sample Input], [Sample Output], and [Submission code], could the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/> occur in the [Submission code]?       
        First, document the reason for your consideration, then conclude the sentence with 'Yes' or 'No'. Should the logical error be correct but fail to align with the description in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>, the response should be 'No'.
        A: This code stores the user's input value in the array arr and then adds it to the variable sum. However, when implementing the algorithm, if the variable i of the for loop is the value of N, it will refer to the memory allocated to the array arr, causing an error. At this point, since the loop iterates normally n times, using i-1 as the array index can resolve the error. Therefore, this is an Array/String error and is different from the Loop error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>. "No"
    </Example 1>
    <Example 2>
        [Programming Quiz]: 
        Write a program to calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to N.

        [Input]: 
        The first line contains an integer N.

        [Output]: 
        Print the sum of natural numbers from 1 to N.

        [Submission code]: 
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
            int N;
            int i = 1;
            int sum = 0;
        
            cin >> N;
            
            while (i < N) {
                sum += i
                i++
            }
            
            cout << sum << endl;
            
            return 0;
        }

        Q: Considering the [Programming Quiz], [Input], [Output], [Sample Input], [Sample Output], and [Submission code], could the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/> occur in the [Submission code]?       
        First, document the reason for your consideration, then conclude the sentence with 'Yes' or 'No'. Should the logical error be correct but fail to align with the description in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>, the response should be 'No'.
        A: This code uses a while loop to iterate from i = 1 to N-1, adding values to sum. Therefore, the sum of the values from 1 to N-1, not the sum from 1 to N as specified in the [Programming Quiz], is stored in sum. As a result, this is a Loop error due to incorrect use of the loop. And the Loop error is the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>. "Yes"

    <Example 3>
        [Programming Quiz]:
        Write a program to determine if a given number is a prime number.

        [Input]: 
        The first line contains an integer N.

        [Output]: 
        Print whether N is a prime number or not.

        [Sample Input]:
        17

        [Sample Output]:
        prime number

        [Submission code]: 
        #include <iostream>
        #include <cmath> 
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
            int N;
            bool isPrime = true;

            cin >> N;

            if (N == 1) {
                isPrime = false;
            } else {
                for (int i = 2; i < sqrt(N); ++i) {
                    if (N % i == 0) {
                        isPrime = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (isPrime) {
                cout << "prime number" << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "not a prime number" << endl;
            }

            return 0;
        }

        Q: Considering the [Programming Quiz], [Input], [Output], [Sample Input], [Sample Output], and [Submission code], could the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/> occur in the [Submission code]?       
        First, document the reason for your consideration, then conclude the sentence with 'Yes' or 'No'. Should the logical error be correct but fail to align with the description in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>, the response should be 'No'.
        A: This code uses a for loop to check whether the user input value stored in N is a prime number or not. However, because i only takes values from 2 to sqrt(N)-1, it does not check whether N is divisible at i = sqrt(N). Therefore, when there is a prime number that is divisible at sqrt(N), it does not work as intended in the [Programming Quiz]. Therefore, it is a Loop error and is the error described in <Description and examples of one error among the ten types of logical errors/>. "Yes"
